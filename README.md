# Energy Log Parser

This is a simple Python project I built during my internship to parse and format electrical log data.

## Features 

- Parses and sorts electrical data 
- Groups entries by timestamp 
- Outputs a clean and structured .csv format (but instead of comma separation, it uses a semicolon for easier Excel compatibility).
- Runs and sorts through 58k lines of .txt in approximately 0.11 seconds

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lukajekul/energy-log-parser.git
cd energy_log_parser
```

## Usage 

Run the sorting script in your terminal:
```bash
python energy_log_parser.py
```
Follow the prompts to:
- Enter the path to your input .txt file
- Enter the path for the output .csv

## Example

examples are given in the repository:
- example input : input_example.txt ( This input is generated by the computer as a form of documentation or presentation of the user's electricity usage. It is only a showcase of my code, and it's unlikely you'll encounter this kind of data elsewhere. )
- example output data : output_example.csv

## Probable problems 

- When opening the file in Excel, depending on your settings, the . used as a decimal point might be misinterpreted as a date.

## Error handeling

- Input does not end with .txt
- Input path does not exist
- Output does not end with .csv
- Output path does not exist
