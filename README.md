# Energy Log Parser

This is a simple Python project i have built during my internship, that takes a .txt file, sorts the data and outputs a strustured .csv file

## Features 

- Parses and sorts electrical data 
- Groups by time stamp 
- OUtputs clean and structured .csv format
- Runs and sorts through 58k lines of .txt in approximately 0.11 seconds

## InstalLation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lukajekul/energy-log-parser.git
cd energy_log_parser
```

## Usage 

Run the sorting script in your terminal:
```bash
python energy_log_parser.py
```
Follow the prompts to:
- Enter the path to your input .txt file
- Enter the path for the output .csv

## Example

examples are given in the repository:
- example input : input_example.txt ( This output is generated by the computer as a form of documentation or presentation of the user's electric usage. Again, this is only a showcase of my code, and it's unlikely you'll ecounter this kind of data elsewhere )
- example output data : output_example.csv
